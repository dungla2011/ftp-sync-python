**A way to safe your data, avoid lost data by Virus, Randsomware** 

I find many soft to sync file to FTP Server, but all are not free and ofcourse no source code. So I make one to my need.

I use this to backup my PC to an FTP server. I'am afraid of Virus, Ransomware, it may be attack my PC, so backup to remote server is a good way to safe data!
I saw some people who are victim of virus, ransomware... hacker required pay money to decrypt data... it's really a nighmare.

I keep all my data of my PC more than 20 years to now. I alway think about the case if my HDD is die, then what data will be lost, so I research many way to backup. This tool is belong series of tool in my backup system. I will update here when I have time to complete other documents about backup.

Some functions:
- Upload a folder automatically to FTP server
- Loop sleep 1 hour to scan new file an upload
- Retry when connection is error
- Resume upload a file if remote filesize smaller than local filesize
- Source code file from 001...007... is step by step from very simple to complete this program

This is simple program for my work, so it's not designed a nice UI!

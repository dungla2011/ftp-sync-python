# ftp-sync-python
Very simple FTP client, sync folder to FTP server, use python, opensource

I find many soft to sync file to FTP Server, but it need to buy. So I make one to my need.
I use it to backup my PC to an FTP server, I'am afraid of Virus, Ransomeware, it may be attack my PC, so backup to remote server is a good way to safe data!

Some functions:
- Upload a folder automatically to FTP server
- Loop sleep 1 hour to scan new file an upload
- Retry when connection is error
- Resume upload a file if remote file smaller than local file
- Source file from 001...007 is step by step from very simple to complete this program

This is simple program for my work, so it's not designed nice UI!
